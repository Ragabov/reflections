How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could see what differences between the files without manually exploring both files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would help recovering from errors and typos, I will have versions of the software product
	making it easier to switch back to an older versions or even ship older ones

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros : more logical versions/commits 
	cons : prone to user error, for example forgetting to save changes 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows saving multiple files in once commit, because logical changes may require editing 
	more than a single file , it might effect a number of files which are interrelated
	
	While in google docs, Files are rarely interrelated 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using git log to view all the commits history ,then use git diff to see the changes made 
	into a specific commit from another previous one.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because if a bug was introduced , i could simply checkout to the last working commit/version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	For version control in every single project from now on
